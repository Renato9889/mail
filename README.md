<ul>
  <li>Send Email: When a user submits the email composition form, it adds the JavaScript code that actually 
    sends the email. Once the email is sent, it appears in the sent mailbox and in the recipient's inbox.</li>
  <li> Mailbox: When a user visits their inbox, sent mailbox, or archived folder, it displays the respective emails in each mailbox. When a mailbox is visited, 
    the application first queries the API to fetch the latest emails in that mailbox.
    Upon visiting a mailbox, the mailbox's name appears at the top of the page. If an email is unread, it appears with a white background.
    If the email has been read, it appears with a gray background.</li>
  <li>View Email: When a user clicks on an email, they are taken to a preview where they can see the content of that email. 
    The application displays the sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and the email body. </li>
  <li>Archive and Unarchive: Allows users to archive and unarchive received emails.</li>
  <li>"Reply: Allows users to respond to an email.</li>
  
</ul>
